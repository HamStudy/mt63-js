# @hamstudy/mt63

TypeScript implementation of MT63 digital mode for amateur radio communication.

## About

This project provides a TypeScript library for encoding and decoding MT63 digital mode signals, commonly used in amateur radio. The implementation is based on the fldigi MT63 code and developed by the HamStudy.org team.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** - This library is currently under development and not yet ready for production use.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @hamstudy/mt63
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { encodeString, initRx, processAudio } from '@hamstudy/mt63';

// Encode text to MT63 audio
const audioBuffer = encodeString(
  'Hello World',
  bandwidth,
  longInterleave,
  audioContext
);

// Decode MT63 audio to text
initRx(bandwidth, interleave, integration, squelch);
const decodedText = processAudio(audioSamples, sampleRate, length);
```

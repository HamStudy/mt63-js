# @hamstudy/mt63

TypeScript implementation of MT63 digital mode for amateur radio communication.

## About

This project provides a TypeScript library for encoding and decoding MT63 digital mode signals, commonly used in amateur radio. The implementation is based on the fldigi MT63 code and developed by the HamStudy.org team.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** - This library is currently under development and not yet ready for production use.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @hamstudy/mt63
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { MT63tx, MT63rx } from '@hamstudy/mt63';

// Encode text to MT63 audio samples
const encoder = new MT63tx(1000, false); // 1000Hz bandwidth, short interleave
const { samples, sampleRate } = encoder.encodeString('Hello World');

const audioBuffer = audioCtx.createBuffer(1, samples.length, sampleRate);
audioBuffer.copyToChannel(samples, 0);

const audioSource = audioCtx.createBufferSource();
audioSource.buffer = audioBuffer;
audioSource.connect(audioCtx.destination);
audioSource.start();

// Decode MT63 audio to text
const decoder = new MT63rx(1000, false, 4, 8.0); // bandwidth, interleave, integration, squelch
const decodedText = decoder.processAudio(audioSamples);
```
